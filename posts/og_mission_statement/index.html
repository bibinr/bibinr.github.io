        <p>Leaving an indelible impression at every organization I have been a part of has been my attempt all through the years and I am glad to mention that I have been successful at doing so. I intend to take this strong resolve and persevering attitude further as I progress with my career!</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a candidate with exceptional experience and can adapt, prioritize and handle a variety of tasks with accuracy, I believe I will be a perfect fit to your needs. Here is why I believe in it.</p>
<p>• Technical ability: I am passionate about technology and the power it holds to bring positive change in people&rsquo;s lives. It is this very passion that keeps me going everyday. I have been well versed with distributed systems, AWS cloud and the linux operating systems. Being an AWS certified Solutions Architect has helped me create elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant and secure systems. Programming to solve problems using the right technologies has been at the core of everything I do.</p>
<p>• Interpersonal Skills: I strongly believe that problems worth solving are often solved by teams and not one person. My ability to communicate clearly, understand the other persons perspective and building consensus has helped me throughout my career. It is this skill that has helped me go from working with 5 people to 50 and scale efficiently to solve problems collectively.</p>
<p>• Leadership: I belong to the &ldquo;leaders are made not born&rdquo; clan. Leading is something I’m extremely passionate, constantly learning and practicing about. I strive to lead with empathy and create more leaders - not followers. Throughout my life, I have lived by this, be it as chairperson of ACM back in college, during different reviews at work or as a volunteer Board member at YMCA. These experiences have helped me polish my skills further and constantly improve myself.</p>
<p>• Versatility: To be adaptable has been my motto all throughout. If a task needs to be done, I do not hesitate to roll up my sleeves and get it done, however mundane it may be. Multi-tasking in a range of roles and responsibilities such as being a security and privacy advocate, training others on Linux, AWS etc. has helped me be a well rounded engineer.</p>
